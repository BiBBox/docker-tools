Download these two files and run 
`docker-compose up` 

First run will download and install Oracle 11 g database container and I2B2 installer (with Boston demo data), next will start servers. 

**Warning** : Download and install processes can take long time. During install, java errors may occur since active database instance is required, and the script will loop until connection is enabled.
